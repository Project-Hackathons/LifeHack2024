        "In the context of terrorism, reports and articles often contain extensive, unstructured text that is challenging to analyze and cross-reference in an automated manner. For instance, articles about a single terror incident might arrive at different times throughout the day, each with varying details. These reports typically include crucial entities such as *persons, objects, locations, and events*.\n",
